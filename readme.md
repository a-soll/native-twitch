# Native Twitch
Native Twitch is a native MacOS app for Twitch with FFZ support. Still in very early development.

## For FFZ support
1. Right click Native Twitch.app and click Show Package Contents
2. Navigate to Contents/Resources and paste your FFZ settings json file there.

* This is going to be resolved in application settings later on
